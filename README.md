# receipts-api
Study project using Golang + fasthttp + MongoDB driver.

****

### Project

receipts-api is an rest api to store receipt links along with some notes. 

The purpouse is to keep Golang codding skills and improve and/or test some concepts.

### Tech Stack

* [Golang](https://golang.org/)
* [Mongo Go Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver)
* [FastHttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp)

### Running

You can run this api project navigating to cmd folder and running build and run. When executing run command you can pass a third argument as dev, qa or prod indicating the environment you want to execute. When no arg is passing it will assume dev.


##### Navigate to cmd folder
``
cd cmd
``

##### build
``
go build
``

##### run without argument will assume dev envirnment
``
go run main.go
``

##### run with one of those arguments on list
``
go run  main.go [dev, qa, prod]
``

You can check the environment configurations on fodler
configs/files/mongodb and configs/files/server  by its indication on config.mongodb.<env>.json. Exampels:
* config.mongodb.dev.json
* config.server.dev.json


### Running with docker

``
docker build -t receipts-api .
``

then 

``
docker run -d --name dev-receipts-api -p 8087:8061 receipts-api
``

Executes the business rules, such as validations.

3. Repository

Execute commands on MongoDB
